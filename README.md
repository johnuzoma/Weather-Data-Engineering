** Please note: I am no longer using OpenWeatherMap API for this project. I am using the Met Eireann API. **

Using pipeline activities and PySpark notebooks in MS Fabric, I pulled Dublin's weather data from the Met Eireann API, cleased/transformed it and created a dashboard to track weather warnings and forecasts.
